# C4 Knowledge Seekers – Core Java Programming Solutions

Welcome to the **C4 Knowledge Seekers – Core Java Programming** solutions repository!
This repo contains student-submitted solutions to the practice problems listed at the [Core Java Programming](https://c4knowledgeseekers.in/practice-problems/core-java-programming) page. ([C4 Knowledge Seekers][1])

---

## 📚 About

This repository aims to:

* Provide working Java code solutions for each of the Core Java topics on the site.
* Help students compare approaches, learn from each other, and improve their programming skills.
* Serve as a reference library for future students (and current ones) to see well-structured, clean Java code for common problems.

## 🧭 Topics Covered

The problems are organized by topics as per the site. Some of the topics include:

* 2D ARRAYS
* APPLETS
* BASIC PROGRAMMING CONSTRUCTS
* DATA CONVERSION
* DELEGATION EVENT MODEL
* EXCEPTION HANDLING
* FUNCTIONS
* GUI (AWT)
* INHERITANCE
* INPUT/OUTPUT
* INTERFACES
* JDBC
* MULTITHREADING
* OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
* PACKAGES
* SINGLE DIMENSION ARRAYS
* STRINGS

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Here’s the suggested folder / file structure:

```
/
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE (if applicable)
├── topics/
│   ├── basic_programming_constructs/
│   │   ├── ProblemName1.java
│   │   ├── ProblemName2.java
│   │   └── ...

└── template/
    └── JavaTemplate.java
```

* Each topic has its own folder under **topics/**
* Java files named clearly by problem name (CamelCase or meaningful names)
* A **template/** folder to store a generic template file which students can copy when writing solutions

## 🧰 Java Program Template

Here is a sample template that each Java solution should follow for consistency:

```java
/**
 * Problem: <Problem Title>
 */

package topics.<topic_name>;  // e.g. topics.strings

public class <ProblemName> {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO: Your solution starts here

        // 1. Read input (if any)
        // 2. Process / logic
        // 3. Output result

        // Example:
        // Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        // int n = sc.nextInt();
        // ...
    }

    // You may add helper methods if needed, e.g.:
    // private static <ReturnType> helperMethod( ... ) { ... }
}
```

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repo (if using personal GitHub accounts).
2. Create a new branch, ideally named something like `topic-problemName` or `strings-ReverseString`.
3. Add your solution file under the correct topic folder in **topics/**.
4. Follow the Java Program Template above.
5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a description of what you’ve done: which problem, key idea of your approach.
6. If there are multiple solutions (e.g. more efficient / simpler / using different methods), feel free to include both, but name them clearly (e.g. `ProblemName_Simple.java`, `ProblemName_Optimized.java`).

---

## ✅ Coding Standards and Best Practices

* Use meaningful class and file names.
* Include comments where logic is complex.
* Handle edge cases (e.g. null, empty input, large input).
* Keep code readable: proper indentation, spacing, etc.
* If using external libraries, mention dependencies (but for core Java, try to stick with JDK).

If you like, I can generate a **CONTRIBUTING.md** to go alongside this, or format the README with badges and auto-table of contents. Do you want me to build that?
